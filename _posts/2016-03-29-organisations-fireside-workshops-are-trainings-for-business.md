Organisations: Fireside Workshops are trainings for businesses, schools, and other organisations that need customised programs. Organisations are best served by a needs assessment approach. Each workshop will be made tailored to  organisational competencies and weaknesses. 

Each organisation will receive an assessment to determine what type of training will make them most productive. Second a contract will be created that insures all levels of management are included in the training. Third, a Standard Feedback Procedure will be designed and a contact person selected to make sure programs are held accountable.
